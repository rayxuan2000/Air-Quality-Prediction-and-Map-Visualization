# Air-Quality-Prediction-and-Map-Visualization

## Introduction
This project is about applying regression models on a health-related dataset containing air quality in a given coordinate on the map. The main purpose of this project is to 

(1) get familiar with geo-related coding on the map. What is a geopandas dateframe? What is the most commonly used coordiante reference system? How to map the data points on the real map? What are some of the basic geometry type in the GeoDataFrame (POINT, LINESTRING, POLYGON...) and so on so forth.

(2) make full use of the explanatory role of machine learning models. How to interpret given feature importance? Any fancy but meaningful way of describing the feature importance so as to better make data-driven decisions?

## Data and Code
The data and code has been uploaded under this repo.
